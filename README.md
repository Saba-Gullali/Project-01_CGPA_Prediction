# Project-01_CGPA_Prediction
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict a studentâ€™s CGPA based on their IQ level. Using a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn, the system learns the relationship between IQ scores and CGPA values from a dataset of college students where the IQ and CGPA are in slightly inverse relationship.
